# Segment Changer
Segment changer lets you change the number of segments/vertices of a primitive even after it has been moved.

This tool only supports Blender 2.8 and above.

## Installation
1. Download the .zip file from GitHub
2. In Blender, go to Edit - Preferences - Add-ons
3. Click on the "Install..." button on the top-right
4. Locate the .zip file and select Install Add-on
5. Activate it by clicking on the checkbox

## How to use
The tool is placed in the N panel in the 3D viewport.

Select a primitive you just put in place and then in the panel specify the number of segments you'd like to have. Then press the 'Apply' button

## Notes
The tool is for changing the vertices after they are moved in place. With this in mind please note the following:
- It cannot reproduce an edited mesh
- It only works if you didn't rename your object yet.
- It is limited to Circles, Cylinders and UV Spheres as these are the cases where I ever found the tool useful
